# MakeItMaterial
Udacity android developer nanodegree project p5

## Overview

Project to take an older version of the application and use material design concepts like appcompat, floating actionbutton,
collapsing toolbar, cardview, recycler view, co-ordinator layout, appbar layout etc.

## Rubric for evaluation

* App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
* App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
* App theme extends from AppCompat.
* App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
* App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
* App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
* App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
* App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
* App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.

## Libraries Used

* Android Design library
* OkHttp
